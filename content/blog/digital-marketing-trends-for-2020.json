It\n\nis essential to keep up with the trends in Digital Marketing: Knowing which are the booming\n\nchannels, the strategies that seems to be more effective, what is losing effectiveness….\n\nThese forecasts give the possibility to innovate and bet on strategies that are consolidated based on\n\nthe experience of the professionals that every day we see the evolution of a sector that is constantly\n\nchanging and that can offer you a competitive advantage with respect to your competition.\n\nSo, what are the trends in digital marketing in 2020?\n\n## Voice searches\n\nThis already had its peak in 2019, but in 2020 Alexa, Google Home, Homepod and others will be\n\nfashionable. We are in the ‘beginnings’ of dogmatization through these tools and there is a lot of\n\njuice to be taken out.\n\nAs more people use these tools, more information will be collected, and the results offered by voice\n\nsearches will be better understood.\n\nCertainly, SEO will have to focus even more on this type of search, so offering optimal content with\n\nthese issues in mind will be very useful.\n\n## Quick answers\n\nIn line with the above, when you search for something by voice you want (in many cases) quick\n\nanswers, get to the point, do not find the typical article of 2000 words to position.\n\nIf we look for ‘what are the colours of the rainbow’ we don&#39;t want to know why it is produced,\n\nwhere to see it and more content used to create long and quality texts.\n\nWhat we are looking for now are short answers and to be told directly what the colours of the\n\nrainbow are, as if we were driving and we needed to know quickly to take one street or another.\n\nThis is already observed by Google and is what it offers as Featured Snippets, which are summaries\n\nof the most relevant article content and that in one part of it answers the question.\n\nHowever, not always the best positioned article for a topic, in this case ‘rainbow colours’, is the one\n\nthat best responds clearly and concisely to the specific question.\n\nWill Google continue to show featured snippets of the best positioned articles for the topic we are\n\nlooking for? Will it begin to offer fragments of other articles perhaps not so well positioned but that\n\nrespond more directly? Will it stop giving importance to the extension of the text and other SEO\n\noptimization factors and give more to the text, although 300 words in question, is more useful in\n\nresponse?\n\n## WhatsApp Business\n\n![Digital Marketing Trends for 2020](https://ucarecdn.com/b948b0da-5da0-49c8-90a3-1c1ec3591dfd/ \"Digital Marketing Trends for 2020\")\n\nWhile in China both companies and users used WeChat, an application that takes the lead in all its\n\naspects to WhatsApp, the latter is the most used in Australia.\n\nWhatsApp has long incorporated WhatsApp Business, but it is something that can still get a lot more\n\ninto society and companies, making it more widely used and in many more ways.\n\nIf WhatsApp Business gives a boost this year, we can see substantial changes in its options such as\n\nlightning deals, groups, lists, Facebook-style walls and much more.\n\n## More and more courses\n\nThe courses have become the business of the century, wherever you look there are courses of all\n\nkinds, at all prices and all modalities.\n\nGoogle has noticed and like offering bus routes and schedules without having to enter the transport\n\nconsortium website, and we have no doubt that it will do the same with online courses, acting as an\n\nintermediary and buying them directly to him.\n\n## Google monopolization\n\nAs with the sale of courses, collaborative consumption and the sale of second-hand products is\n\ngrowing. If Google wants, it will start doing the same in these sectors and it will be skipped to\n\ncompanies.\n\nIn summary, Google could first follow the following 2 ways:\n\nIt will jump to companies and offer a platform for people to do the same functions\n\nIt will offer results like in Google Shopping, it will be an intermediary of other companies such as\n\nAmazon and it will take its commission. Have you thought about the importance of doing SEO on\n\nAmazon?\n\nHowever, it should be noted that I see this as gradual and will not have its great moment in 2020, as\n\nGoogle would finally accuse monopoly.\n\n## Facebook integration - Instagram - WhatsApp\n\nAs we know, Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp. However, much is missing for an ideal\n\nintegration between these platforms.\n\nLike Google, if Facebook gets the batteries this year, it can offer a new platform with a multitude of\n\nfunctions.\n\nAmong these, again the sale of second-hand products and again, something similar to WeChat,\n\nwhich I would define as the greatest example of integration of what these 3 platforms could be\n\ntogether.\n\n## Specialised networks\n\nThe content is beginning to be obsolete, as we have pointed out we suffer from intoxication.\n\nWe search something on Google and find 3 million results with answers, 300 youtubers making\n\nvideos and a few thousand infographics.\n\nHowever, how much? And who writes all that? Unfortunately, in the meantime the quality is lost,\n\ndistinguishing between all that content and the truthful and useful content is complicated, hence the\n\nneed for specialized networks or vertical networks.\n\n## Tutorials\n\nSomething that to date has worked very well for SEO has been the tutorials. These are considered by\n\nGoogle as quality content and useful for the user.\n\nTherefore, tutorials in the field of digital marketing such as how to audit the digitalisation of your\n\nbusiness on the internet, how to position in Google etc., will have a great weight and will continue to\n\nposition during 2019, even more if they are optimized and updated.\n\n## More ads\n\n![Digital Marketing Trends for 2020](https://ucarecdn.com/0a6e1f0b-1bb3-4dec-81ad-50780ba44cf3/ \"Digital Marketing Trends for 2020\")\n\nYes, Facebook and other social networks will remain free (at least open a profile or page on them).\n\nBut if more companies want to digitise and get into the online world (and this will continue to grow)\n\nit means they will pay because their ads are seen to achieve their goals.\n\nThis will have an obvious conclusion and is that social networks will seek their techniques so that\n\nusers consume more ads.\n\n## Everyone wants to be Influencer\n\nThe rise of this job has been abysmal in recent years, and although not everyone can be influencers,\n\nmany have remained as microinfluencers, something that is also demanded and useful for many\n\ncompanies.\n\nInterest in this job will generate new microinfluencers in less exploited niches and therefore more\n\nmarket options and a boom in influencers marketing as well as in companies that are dedicated to\n\nthis sector.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence\n\nArtificial Intelligence cannot be ignored in any article about digital marketing trends, whether 2017,\n\n2018, 2019 or 2020. AI will always take a place.\n\nWithin the AI ​​it is worth noting the chatbots, because little by little we can talk more humanely with\n\nthem. There are few tests that are performed daily to achieve the best communication and thereby\n\nfacilitating work processes.\n\nAs for the latter, work processes bring CRM to the stage.\n\nThese CRMs and as a direct consequence of big data, digitalization, AI and other factors, are\n\nnecessary in large companies to facilitate these processes and make digital marketing much more\n\neffective.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n2020 seems like an exciting year for the world of digital marketing even without knowing for sure\n\nwhat it will hold. However, we have been able to give some guidelines to be prepared and face it,\n\npointing out some typical and less typical trends that will happen, that could happen and should\n\nhappen.",
