In other words, it is how satisfied the customer is after using one of these items.\r\n\nThis goes beyond the ease of completing tasks on your company's website. User experience is related to user satisfaction and measures the accessibility, usability and efficiency of customer interaction with company services.\r\n\n \r\n\n## User experience is all about people, not design\r\n\n \r\n\nThere are several elements that contribute to the design of good experiences, such as user interface, usability, and search engines. However, the design of the experience is not the same as the user experience. It seems redundant, but UX is what people actually experience, not the separate elements that UX professionals gather to influence the experience. Optimizing and refining design components can considerably affect how the end user feels, but there will always be some elements that are beyond the control of the designer.\r\n\n \r\n\nWhile there is no reason why the user experience cannot be applied to physical interactions, the term is generally reserved for interactions with digital technology. This is evidenced by the way UX methodologies focus on areas such as wireframing, usability, and other specific digital processes.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Fundamental pillars of UX\r\n\n> 1. Aesthetics\r\n\nAesthetics is certainly not the single most important element of the user experience, but it is one of the pillars when we consider it. Why?\r\n\nFirst impressions serve to give a sense of what the rest of the experience will look like. Thus, an attractive interface already strengthens the user's confidence that navigation will be good.\r\n\n \r\n\n> 2. Usability\r\n\nUsability is crucial to complement aesthetics, to make the look not only beautiful, but also functional.\r\n\nUsability defines how easily and efficiently users can navigate the site or app. The better usability, most likely the person will be satisfied with the overall experience.\r\n\n \r\n\n> 3. Architecture\r\n\nInformation architecture deals with how information is organised on a page.\r\n\nIn other words, well-done AI work is one that puts the most important information in focus and direct users' attention to the right places on the page.\r\n\nWithout it, the interface can be beautiful and easy to use, but will not lead to conversions.\r\n\n \r\n\n> 4. Interaction Flows\r\n\nInteraction flows are maps of the different paths the user will take when using your product. This way, the person will always know where they are and what are the next steps they can take while browsing.\r\n\nThis helps users locate and keep in mind the possibilities the product offers, rather than feeling lost and searching for features that do not exist.\r\n\n \r\n\n> 5. Content\r\n\nContent is critical to a good user experience. Imagine, for example, an institutional website that has all the other pillars but lacks the relevant content.\r\n\nThe user will not get a good experience and will leave the page (probably never to return).\r\n\nWhen used well, on the other hand, content gives practical instructions and helpful information that will further enrich their experience.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Why user experience is crucial to your digital marketing strategy\r\n\n\n\nWhat aspects of digital marketing strategy does user experience really make a difference? The answer is very simple: everything!\r\n\nAn essential point to keep in mind is that this experience is defined by all user interactions with your brand, so if at some point the person has a disappointment, the whole experience will be compromised.\r\n\nAlso, good user experience is all about helping visitors navigate efficiently and provoking positive feelings as they do so.\r\n\nIt is obvious that the relationship with a persona who is satisfied will be much more peaceful and lasting than dealing with someone frustrated and nervous.\r\n\n \r\n\nTo show help you understand, here are 4 moments of the brand-customer relationship that affect the relationship with your persona:\r\n\n \r\n\n## Attention and engagement\r\n\nFrom the first contact with your brand, which will probably be through the content of your website, the need to create a positive experience is already evident.\r\n\nIf the read is difficult, with too many distractions and pop-ups, the time spent on the site will be shorter and the engagement will be insufficient to generate leads.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Buying decision\r\n\nThe purchase decision is also greatly affected by the user experience.\r\n\nEspecially in e-commerce, elaborate forms, security seals placed in strategic places and other navigation elements can guarantee a greater number of purchases.\r\n\nLanding pages also follow the same principle: The better the user experience, the higher the number of conversions.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Support Requests\r\n\nCustomers who need support often do so because of a problem that they couldn't solve on their own.\r\n\nNow think that to ask for help, they face a confusing and tiring process. How willing are you to talk to the attendants? Are they likely to cooperate or fight?\r\n\nOn the other hand, when the experience is pleasant it will be easier to report the problem and get help without delay.\r\n\n \r\n\n> Recommendations\r\n\nWhat about the recommendations that come from brand loyal customers? They will be much more frequent for those who feel confident of a good digital experience.\r\n\nThe opposite is also true: If the user experience is not so good, customers may even continue to use your product, but are unlikely to be inclined to recommend it to others.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Design Thinking or UX?\r\n\n##  \r\n\nDesign Thinking is a methodology used by designers to solve complex problems and find desirable solutions for customers. Design Thinking relies on logic, imagination, intuition and systemic thinking to explore the possibilities of what it could be and to create the desired results that benefit the end user (the customer).\r\n\nUX Design, on the other hand, addresses all iterations between users, products and services and their motivations, anxieties and behavioral patterns. The goal is to build products that are not only useful but deeply desired by customers.\r\n\nIn a nutshell, Design Thinking is more concerned with creating new products intelligently, thinking about innovation, while UX Design aims to develop truly excellent, user-focused products.",
