  "body": "You’ve probably heard many good things about WordPress at this stage. The platform has many functionalities and advantages for small business and is one of the most popular publishing platforms in the world. Today it is used by 29% of internet blogs and has conquered this place for being open source software.\r\n\nWordPress has in fact its advantages; however, it should not be used to build your e-commerce platform or your travel website and here’s why:\r\n\n\r\n\n## Constant security threats\r\n\nProbably the highest in the priority rank, the security problem is a constant worry for WP users. Most WordPress installations (ie those in which the user is unaware of implementing additional security solutions) are extremely vulnerable.\r\n\nBecause of this lack of security, hackers tend to look for WP blogs and websites to attack. Spam is also a major platform issue and malicious code plugins are not as uncommon as they should be.\r\n\nAnother point to be aware about using WordPress, is the need of updating the software regularly, or your website risks being compromised. The upgrade itself is simple as one click, but individual plugins can cause problems, which in turn can disable your entire website in worst case. If you don’t possess enough technical knowledge, this might go beyond your capabilities.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Lack of support\r\n\nUnlike other paid CMS platforms, WordPress offers no support at all for its users. Although there are forums and help pages, the knowledge found there is generally built by other users. Because of this “informal support” many questions go unanswered and some chronic issues can destroy your user experience.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Problems with PHP\r\n\nWordPress was written in PHP and that’s why many developers and experts have stopped using it. The point is that PHP is not an easy language to learn and if you want to modify any of the features of your e-commerce website you will have to master it. This causes the site to be deprecated from other types of CMS, written in friendlier programming languages.\r\n\nOther issue is the current updates. Themes and plugins undergo through updates, meaning Google’s webmaster tool needs to make periodic site visits. The administrator of WP website should login into the site panel periodically to check if any tools, themes, plugins needs to be updated. By doing so, you can fix this deficiency manually and security does not get compromised.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Free theme vulnerabilities\r\n\nWhile free themes are hands-on and can make life easier for those unfamiliar with design and development, they can also put your website at risk. Many themes found on the internet have a hidden code, malicious links and plugins that can do more harm than good.\r\n\nAlso, paid tools and plugins are expensive to acquire – there are many free plugins that might meet your needs.  However, as any other company, most plugins offers a paid version, which can be quite expensive. They range from $10 to $500. If you want to invest in a paid domain, theme, layout and plugins, the final bill may be more expensive than hiring a professional do develop your e-commerce platform.  \r\n\n\r\n\n## Inconsistent Documentation\r\n\nBecause unsupported, users rely on your documentation to know what to do. However, the documentation is often inconsistent and full of incomplete information. If you never have a problem with WordPress this will not affect you, but at the sign of any slightly more complex doubt non-existent documentation can cause you many headaches.\r\n\n \r\n\n## Third Party Providers\r\n\nWordPress is an Open Source platform, which means the source code is made available for use or modification to all. Anyone can have access to the code and develop plugins and tools to integrate with WP and therefore your website.\r\n\nDue its open source characteristics, WP utilises many plugins to bring an e-commerce platform to life. In fact, you cannot build an e-commerce without plugins. This CMS (Content Management System) acts as the “heart” of your online store and it’s necessary to install plugins to add more functionality to the manager.\r\n\nWith different plugins in your platform, your website is vulnerable to hacker attacks, it’s dependent on third party providers and lack of assistance.\r\n\n \r\n\nWordPress is indeed a great platform to create your blog page, however is not the most adequate option when it comes to building e-commerce sites. To build a secure, reliable and totally customisable online store, [the best option is to hire professionals and specialists ](https://www.cavaon.com/start-a-project)to develop the most suitable solution for your company.",
