  "body": "Has your website helped you achieve your business goals? Are there sales sourced from it? Does your audience have a good browsing experience? If you've been thoughtful about finding the answer to these questions, maybe it's time to redo the company website.\n\nWhen you realise that this channel has not served as a strategic tool you were hoping for, it's time to analyse bugs, think about modifications, and reframe pages. After all, in a time when people live connected, it’s not possible to ignore the quality standards demanded by the public and search engines.\n\nFor this reason, we created this post. Let's talk about the top 5 signs that your company's website needs a makeover. Check it out:\n\n## 1. Your website does not appear on Google\n\n![why-you-should-upgrade-your-website ](https://ucarecdn.com/ed52b550-e917-4b2a-8ff3-e219f145bc55/ \"why-you-should-upgrade-your-website \")\n\nThe first sign has to do with the visibility of your page to search engines. As you might imagine, Google is one of the great sources of traffic to the pages and displayed in the search results. After all, it’s very uncommon that someone would access a website directly by typing the URL in the address bar.\n\nInstead, a visitor can use a browser to serve as a shortcut to the website, especially when their interest is for some specific information, content or offer.\n\nNow imagine that someone is looking for “Flights to China” or “Hawaii Holiday Packages” but your page does not appear amongst the top search results. Think about the traffic you would be missing out and the potential customers that were not impacted by your brand.\n\nIf your company is experiencing this scenario, it’s time to realise the importance of optimising your website for search engines (SEO). \n\n## 2. \"Responsive\" or \"mobile\" are terms unknown to you\n\n![why-you-should-upgrade-your-website ](https://ucarecdn.com/0e2fc833-c396-4752-ba2f-9f080a4ba0c3/ \"why-you-should-upgrade-your-website \")\n\nHave you ever heard of responsive design? That term may even be unknown to you, and at first this is not a serious problem. What really matters is if your page is not optimized for use on mobile devices.\n\nAnd that's what responsive design is all about: making the pages friendly for mobile access. That means adjusting layouts, buttons, text size, and everything else that interferes with the browsing experience of mobile, smartphone, and tablet users.\n\nTo see if your site is well-suited for mobile devices, you can access it from your smartphone and check for navigation issues, such as having to swipe your finger across the screen sideways or having to zoom in to see the text. If you prefer, you can access the [Google Mobile Compatibility Test ](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)free of charge.\n\n## 3. User experience can - and should - improve\n\n![why-you-should-upgrade-your-website ](https://ucarecdn.com/780b239d-c2de-4527-9c2a-666766b8c032/ \"why-you-should-upgrade-your-website \")\n\nWhen people access your page, can they easily accomplish their goals? For example, if a user tries to search for contact in your home page, can he find it without too much trouble? If a visitor wants to book anything related to travel, does the buying process not become dragged?\n\nOnly these two questions already refer to several elements that make up the user experience in a site, such as simplicity, usability, information architecture, content and interaction design.\n\nAs all this may seem very technical, let's try to uncomplicate things. The user experience, also known as UX, works with these and other elements to make the access and navigation of a website more intuitive and pleasant to the public. It's about making the visitors feel in control and get what they want without too much work.\n\n## 4. Your website never generated sales\n\nIs your website designed to be an alternative sales engine for your business? If yes, have the results been satisfactory? If the answer is \"no,\" then you might need to review your page’s purpose and specifics.\n\nThe website is a digital marketing tool, same as social networks and email marketing. No matter how you picture it as a channel for public inquiries, posting content, displaying your portfolio, or exposing company information, there is no denying that your sales could be made or driven from the website. \n\nThe problem is when neither of these occur, i.e. when your site only generates expenses and does not help with the formation of new leads.\n\n## 5. You need to increase the visibility of your brand\n\n![why-you-should-upgrade-your-website ](https://ucarecdn.com/0cf35123-5ee9-4ca5-87d4-f2d2f8e8ae89/ \"why-you-should-upgrade-your-website \")\n\nIn addition to generating sales, one important function of websites is to bring more visibility to their respective brands. After all, it is a channel that should expand the reach of the company, making it connect with more local consumers and, especially, other regions.\n\nThe problem for travel companies that cannot gain popularity on the internet is that many of them believe that just putting a website live for their digital presence be noticed. Don’t be a fool, this is just the first step in a long climb to increase your visibility.\n\nIf your brand is not getting the visibility you need, then it's time to think about changes. \n\nAre you still wondering if your company needs a new website?
