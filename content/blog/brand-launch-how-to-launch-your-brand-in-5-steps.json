Try to establish as much detail as possible, as a specific profile makes it easier and cheaper to apply marketing actions. At the time of the research, both quantitative and qualitative aspects must be considered.\r\n\nA great option is to conduct market research. At this point, the main characteristics of the product can already be traced. It can provide very important data, such as how the product will be received in the market and even the price that the customer is willing to pay.\r\n\nFor the search to succeed, remember to collect the data only from people who will be completely unbiased. Follow a basic road map of simple, unbiased questions that meet all the points you want to spot.

Goals should be specific, measurable and should not run away from reality;\r\n\nStrategy: Choose the best strategy and tactics, defining them according to the platform in which it will be carried out;\r\n\nDeadlines: Be aware whether you are achieving success or not (and correcting problems, if any). These must be realistic and specific;\r\n\nGrowth: This is the percentage of sales you intend to increase in the long run. Just like the other items, it should be realistic.\r\n\n\r\n\n\n\n## 3 â€“ Test it! \r\n\n![brand-launch](https://ucarecdn.com/cd6500d4-ca95-4d51-9330-e3b20e5025ea/ \"How to launch a brand \")\n\n\n\nA great alternative to ensure your investments are not wasted is to conduct tests.
