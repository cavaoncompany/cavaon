# Netlify CMS Setup files.

https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/

Access CMS by going to www.cavaon.com/admin. In order to log in you will need to be invited. Invitations are sent via the Identity tab in the app in Netlify.

Netlify for some reason sends a broken link in the invite. Simply add /admin between the name of the website and the invitation token to fix this. You should see a create password box when the link is correct.

The content of the CMS is configured in the config.yml file. All editable content is listed under collections.
